# Solution for Error: `Error while obtaining UI hierarchy XML file: com.android.ddmlib.SyncException: Remote object doesn't exist!`

## Step 1: Restart ADB and Verify Device Connection
Run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server
adb devices
```
Ensure your emulator appears in the list and is shown as `device` (not `offline` or `unauthorized`).

## Step 2: Check if the Emulator is Fully Booted
Run the following command:
```bash
adb -s emulator-5556 shell getprop sys.boot_completed
```
The output should return `1` if the emulator is fully booted.

## Step 3: Restart Your Emulator
Close the current emulator and restart it:
```bash
adb -s emulator-5556 emu kill
```
Then start it again using the AVD Manager or the command line.
